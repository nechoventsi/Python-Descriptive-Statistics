In the theory of probability and statistics the concepts of mean and mathematical expectation are often used as synonyms, for the assessment of central tendency in a probability distribution, or in the values of a random variable which is characterized in that distribution. On the other hand, in order to evaluate the noise in the data or deviations of that data from the central average value, we can use statistical estimates by variation, dispersion or standard deviation. When looking for a correlation between variables in an astronomical excerpt or database, we usually resort to the use of the correlation coefficient *r* or to the application of a linear / non-linear regression.

Such statistical evaluations are applied in virtually all areas of science, where astronomy is no exception. The methods described in this project could be used to define the statistical properties of astronomical catalogs or experimentally derived data from an observational program. Of course, most of these formulas are usually implemented in the software that we use to analyze the data, but the aim of the current project is to show the possible implementations of these methods in Python using *lists*, *conditional blocks*, *iteration*, *reading and writing* a file, etc.

## Descriptive Statistics

Writing a program that takes tabular data from a file and calculates the following statistical estimates:

* Generaluzed mean
* Variance
* Covariance
